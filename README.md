# [Tool Box] Warcraft-Source: Essentials
This is an easy-to-install package which provides your server with multiple fixes and commands for Tha Pwned's version of the Warcraft-Source modification which can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/ThaPwned/WCS).


## Requirements
For this package to work, it is required that you first install the following:
- [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)
- [EventScripts-Emulator](https://github.com/Ayuto/EventScripts-Emulator)
- [Warcraft-Source](https://github.com/ThaPwned/WCS)


## What does this package do? - And what does it contain?
This package fixes most of the common bugs and issues that a server owner may elsewise encounter when he is running a Warcraft-Source server. The package also contains multiple server commands which are used by many races, without these commands those races will either partially or completely be unfunctional. The package also contains multiple sound files which are used in some races, in addition it also contains a lot of material files, these files are required in order for server to display the visual effects that every race have. To make it easier for people to install and use this package, I have included a download and precacher plugin along with a list of all the materials and sounds that are included in this package.


## Step-by-step installation guide
NOTE: If you already have your own Download & Precacher system, then be careful not overwriting your downloads.ini with the one provided in this package.
- Go to your csgo or cstrike directory (NOTE! Some servers name this directory the server's IP instead).
- Drag and drop the two folders named: "cfg" and "addons" in to the directory.
- Now go to csgo/cfg find and open the file named: "autoexec.cfg"
- Add the text from the file: ```Add this to your autoexec.cfg file``` to your autoexec.cfg file, save the changes, and close both the files.
- Now go to csgo/cfg find and open the file named: "server.cfg"
- Add the text from the file: ```Add this to your server.cfg file``` to your server.cfg file, save the changes, and close both the files.
- That is all, you can now restart your server.
