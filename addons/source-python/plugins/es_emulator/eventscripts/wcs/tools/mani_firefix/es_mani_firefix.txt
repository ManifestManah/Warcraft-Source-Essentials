//This script will fix the following problems that seem to appear only in Counter-Strike: Source:
//
//1) An issue which causes all damaging skills using es damage not to apply the desired damage to the target.
//
//2) An issue which results in players maintaining their gravity from their current race onto whatever other
//   race they may change to, even if the race they change to does not have any gravity altering skill in their kit.
